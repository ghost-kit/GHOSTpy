Instructions
============

Install: 

  $ python setup-cxform.py install

Notes:
* The install command accepts many arguments:
  * Add "--help" for a full list.
  * Add "--prefix=/opt" to install to /opt/python2.X/site-packages
  * Add "--install-lib=/opt/cxform" to install to /opt/cxform

Make sure the module works: 

   $ python cxform_test.py

Important Notes
===============
CXFORM v 0.71 translates points by the radius of the sun.  This
version of cxform-manual.c has line 940 commented out, so it does not
do this translation.
